# Event-Driven Image Processing Workshop Constitution

## Core Principles

### Simplicity
Every component must prioritize simplicity. Avoid unnecessary complexity; prefer straightforward solutions that are easy to understand and maintain. Rationale: Simplifies onboarding and reduces errors in heterogeneous environments.

### Modularity
Design components as independent, reusable modules with clear interfaces. Each module should have a single responsibility and minimal dependencies. Rationale: Enables easy adaptation and execution across different platforms and tools.

### Ease of Execution in Heterogeneous Environments
Ensure all tools and scripts work seamlessly across diverse operating systems, architectures, and toolchains without requiring standardized tooling. Use portable languages and avoid platform-specific dependencies. Rationale: Accommodates users with varying setups in community meetups.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack must support cross-platform execution. No assumptions about specific IDEs or build tools. All code must be runnable with minimal setup.

## Development Workflow

Use version control for all changes. Test on multiple platforms before finalizing. Document setup instructions clearly.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus and documentation. All implementations must verify compliance with principles.
