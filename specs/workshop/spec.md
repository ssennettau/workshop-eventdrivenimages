# Feature Specification: Workshop Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `workshop-implementation`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Build the event-driven image processing workshop materials.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a workshop participant, I want to upload an image via a web UI, see it processed through an event-driven pipeline, and view the results with optional captions, so that I can learn EDA concepts without coding.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a deployed workshop environment, **When** I upload an image via the web UI, **Then** the image is processed and results are displayed.
2. **Given** observability is set up, **When** processing occurs, **Then** metrics and logs show success/failure details.
3. **Given** GenAI is enabled, **When** processing completes, **Then** alt text is generated and stored.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invalid file is uploaded?
- How does the system handle processing failures?
- What if Bedrock access is not granted for GenAI?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Workshop MUST provide a pre-built web UI for image uploads and result visualization.
- **FR-002**: System MUST process uploaded images via event-driven pipeline using EventBridge.
- **FR-003**: Workshop MUST include hands-on activities for configuring EventBridge rules and monitoring.
- **FR-004**: System MUST store processed images and metadata in S3 and DynamoDB.
- **FR-005**: Workshop MUST offer optional GenAI captioning as a value-add extension.
- **FR-006**: System MUST include CloudWatch observability for metrics, logs, and dashboards.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image**: Represents uploaded files, with attributes like filename, size, upload time.
- **Processed Result**: Thumbnail image and metadata, including optional caption.
- **Event**: Represents processing events, with attributes like event type, timestamp, status.
